Coding Quiz gives players the opportunity to test their Javascript fundamentals.

Players have 30 seconds to answer 5 Javascript questions in 30 seconds and for every correct answer, player earns 10 points.

For every wrong answer, player loses 5 seconds from the timer and 10 points are deducted so it's possible for a player to have a negative score.

If the player answers all 5 questions or fails to finish before timer is up, player will be redirected to a webpage containing player's score.

The program was created using HTML/CSS for the frontend and all the backend logic was made possible using Javascript.

Here are screenshots for the website:

This is the welcome screen where the player can either start the quiz or be redirected to High score page containing the most recent score.
